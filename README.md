- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ezhil384
- This repository contains my code for finding the Intraclass coefficient values for the angles of joints of each class.
- The code uses joint coordinates that were given by OpenPose during pose estimation of the videos.
- The dataset used was TinyViratv2 that contains 26 actions of humans from low resolution surveillance footage
